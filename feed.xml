Why bother starting a blog in 2025, when there are literally millions of them already floating around? I’ve been asking myself the same thing, honestly. But the answer I keep coming back to is simple: I just wanted to.</p> <p>There’s something grounding about having a space to sit down, breathe a bit, and write things out. It’s not really about going viral or building some massive audience. It’s more like—me, my thoughts, and a quiet page. That’s all.</p> <p>Writing gives me space to think. It slows everything down in the best way. Sometimes when I’m typing things out, I realize I didn’t really understand how I felt about something until the words showed up in front of me. That space? That clarity? That’s what I’m here for.</p> <p>So this blog is just that. A place to wind down, reflect, maybe untangle a few thoughts. Nothing fancy, no master plan—just a calm corner of the internet to figure stuff out.</p> <p>Still a work in progress. But so am I.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="random"/><category term="intro"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reasons behind my idea of writing things down.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">I decided to swich major for my masters, here’s why.</title><link href="https://eliazonta.github.io/blog/2024/masters/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="I decided to swich major for my masters, here’s why."/><published>2024-07-01T15:09:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-01T15:09:00+00:00</updated><id>https://eliazonta.github.io/blog/2024/masters</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://eliazonta.github.io/blog/2024/masters/"><![CDATA[<p>Just wanted to take a step back and elaborate on why I decided to take a masters in Applied Maths after a bachelors in Computer Science &amp; Engineering.</p> <p>Post WIP.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="random"/><category term="intro"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just wanted to take a step back and elaborate on why I decided to take a masters in Applied Maths after a bachelors in Computer Science &amp; Engineering.]]></summary></entry></feed>
