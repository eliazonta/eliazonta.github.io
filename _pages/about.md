I’m a math nerd with a BSc in CS @ Cornell, but I’ve been all over the quantitative map—parallel computing, high-dim data, low-latency coding. Lately, I’m diving deep into more theoretical math: stochastic processes, random walks, opinion dynamics—basically, all the fun, “complex” stuff that makes systems tick. Always chasing structure in the chaos.


“The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, and wiser people so full of doubts.”

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
